                <h2>CREATING AN ABSTRACT SPORT VISUALISATION</h2>
                <p>The idea is to generate a visualisation of several sport disciplines by recording specific data. This
                    can be data sources such as motion, which includes position, acceleration and rotation, but also
                    non-visual factors like sound and pulse of the athletes. Research and assessment of prerecorded
                    data would be an alternative to recording the data manually, depending on the realisable amount of
                    work. </p>
                <p>The captured data will then be processed by developing fitting algorithms, which enable an artistic
                    visualisation. This will be done with the help of libraries such as P5.js or Processing and
                    therefore either in javascript or java. The generated visuals should not be an obvious simulation of
                    the respective sport, but rather an abstract and creative interpretation. However, each visual
                    representation should have a connection to its data source. This could be a fitting color such as
                    blue for swimming or a recognisable pattern typical for a particular sport.</p>
                <p>The output will be a combination of data-driven movement as well as artistic choices to achieve a
                    visually appealing animation. After completion of the project, the viewer will be able to interact
                    with the visual output. This might include switching and comparing different sports or blending out
                    certain data sources such as audio, which can be used to derive the impact that one data collection
                    has one the whole outcome.</p>
                <p>Hence, it is important to include a concept of data separation while programming. Furthermore, still
                    images will be taken from the animation for a prototypical product design. For example, a still
                    image of a climbing visualisation can be used as a print motif for gear, clothing or posters.</p>
