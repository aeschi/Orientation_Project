# CURRENT STATE

### Visualisation

#### What's the data input:

#### Different Sports
##### Bouldering

### GOALS

#### WORST CASE
INPUT
- [x] research and assesment of prerecorded data
- [x] two sports
- [x] one data source (e.g. motion tracking with 2-3 features position, acceleration, rotation)
- [x] concept of data source seperation (possibility for interaction in BEST case)

OUTPUT
- [x] no interaction 
- [x] the visualisation is animated, but might jitter slightly
- [x] basic represantation of sport (e.g. fitting color)
- [ ] still frames from animation for product design (e.g. gear/shirt with abstract “climbing” illustration)
- [x] visual understanding of input features (no beautification)

#### BEST CASE
INPUT
- [x] recording the data input myself 
- [x] various data sources (e.g. motion tracking, sound, pulse)
- [x] recording at least two sports (e.g. climbing, skating, dancing, etc.)

OUTPUT
- [x] viewer can interact with visualisation (e.g. blending in/out data sources, switch/compare between sports)
- [ ] the abstract visualisation is a smooth animation
- [x] more complex representation of sport (e.g. recognisable pattern typical for a particular sport) -> the sound and repetetive shapes like in swimming I guess..
- [ ] beautification of input features

### NEXT STEPS
- [ ] fix GUI functionality (doable)
- [ ] improve perfomance for smoother animation (we'll see)
- [ ] improve sound animation (doable)
- [ ] create still frames (very doable)
- [ ] final beautification for each sport with color, shapes,.. (doable)
- [ ] sound design/editing for swimming and bouldering (doable)
- [ ] prepare presentation (doable)
